# PastryProtocol
Implementation of pastry protocol used for routing. Pastry is a scalable, distributed object location and routing substrate for wide-area peer-to-peer applications. Pastry performs application-level routing and object location in a potentially very large overlay network of nodes connected via the Internet.

The Bonus file contains the implementation of the system with some failure nodes and how the system adapts to it by updating its routing table.
